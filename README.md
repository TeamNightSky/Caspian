# Caspian
Take control of your music. A fully-featured, self-hosted, open-source music service.

## Objective
The purpose of Caspian is to allow you to control your data, preferences, music, and style. With the rise of many modern streaming services, most of which are managed by large corporations, the fundamental right to control your data has nearly vanished. And thus, Caspian is born.

**Your** music. **Your** data. **Your** service.

## Details
Caspian will use a fully open-source stack, currently planned to be as follows.
- **Backend:** [Django](https://github.com/django/django) + [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
- **Frontend:** [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) + [NextUI](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui)
- **Database:** [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase)
